# Space Battle
<i> Make School INT 1.1 Project </i>

Space Battle is a simple 2-D arcade game built with the `pygame` library. This game is a variation of the popular arcade game "Space Invaders". The user pilots a spacecraft using the arrow keys and shoots lasers by clicking on the spacebar. Enemy spaceships descend from the top of the screen and fire their own lasers at the user's spaceship. The user loses a life if an enemy spaceship passes the bottom of the screen. Additionally, the user loses health points if an enemy laser hits the user spaceship or if an enemy spaceship collides with the user spaceship. The game is over if all lives are spent or if the health bar has been depleted.

## Running the Program


### Resources
Besides reading through `pygame` documentation (which can easily be searched for online) and reviewing the start code for `pygame` from Make School (https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/pygame-lab), I also followed this helpful tutorial to code this game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-__8Xw9KTM.
